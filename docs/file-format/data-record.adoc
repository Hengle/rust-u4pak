= Data Record

*Offset  Size  Type            Description*
     0     ?  Record          file metadata (offset field is 0, N = compressed_size)
_if variant == "Conan Exiles"_
     ?    20  ?               Unknown. Maybe another SHA-1 sum of something?
                              The first 4 bytes have values other than the extra
                              4 bytes in the index record, which is why I didn't
                              put those into the general record structure.
_else if version >= 4 and compression_method != 0x00_
     ?     4  uint32_t        Unknown.
_end_
     ?     N  uint8_t[N]      file data

[NOTE]
====
Starting with version 4 there is an additional 4 bytes in the repeated
*data* record copy (the record that precedes the actual file date, not the
record in the index). I don't know what that is. It is not always the same value.
E.g. it is the same for some files, but different for others. The first 2 bytes
seem to be always the same (`0x78 0x9c` in a v4 and a v7 pak that I saw), so maybe
its 2 16 bit fields?

This is why I've deactivated packing for versions > 3.
